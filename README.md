👋 About Me

Hi, I'm Simon — a retired Army veteran and current Web Stack Developer student at Code Academy, completing this course as part of my rehabilitation and return to the workforce after service-related injuries.

💻 I've been building websites for over 7 years, primarily using WordPress and Shopify, and I currently manage two live projects:

🌐 MyMilitaryStudio.com – a veteran-owned online store

🌍 ToursOfWar.com – a blog dedicated to military history and heritage

I'm passionate about tech, self-improvement, and using digital platforms to honour military service. Now, I'm levelling up my skills with full-stack development, diving deeper into HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js and more.
